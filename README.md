# password generator
this is a simple password generator :)

ADVANCED VERSION


this code is a Python script that generates random passwords based on certain options selected by the user. The script uses the random and string modules to generate the passwords, and the tkinter module to create a window that displays the generated password.

The script defines four variables uppercase_letters, lowercase_letters, digits, and symbols, which contain the uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols that can be used to generate the passwords.

The script also defines four boolean variables upper, lower, nums, and syms, which determine whether the password should contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols, respectively.

The script then initializes an empty string all_chars, which will contain all the characters that can be used to generate the passwords. The script adds the uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols to all_chars based on the options selected by the user.

The script then sets the length of the password to 25 characters and the number of passwords to generate to 10. It generates the passwords using the random.sample() method and prints them to the console.

Finally, the script creates a window using tkinter and displays the generated password in the window when the user clicks a button.
